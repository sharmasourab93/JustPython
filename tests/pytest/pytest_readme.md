# Pytest 


If you know how `assert` works, you know almost what `Pytest` is.

Pytest Works in the fashion of 

- Arrange 
- Act
- Assert 


Pytest can be classified to use as: 
1. Parametrize for examples/multiple samples 
2. Fixtures for setup/reuse
3. Classes for organization


Pytest can be run by two ways: 

1. Grouping by Substring Matching
2. Grouping by Marking
